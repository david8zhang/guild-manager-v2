  - Rock-Paper-Scissors Counters (damage x2):
    - Rangers counter Mages
    - Tanks counter Rangers

  - Ranger main stat is no longer attack, their main stat is speed and attacking multiple times
  - Make it so spells can be used by any hero type, but spells can only be used a limited number of times per match
