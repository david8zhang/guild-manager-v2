# Guild Manager V.2

Fire Emblem crossed with NBA 2K MyGM mode.

## Features to implement for next time:

- Balance changes:

  - Change "support" name to "mage"
  - Make it so spells can be used by any hero type, but spells can only be used a limited number of times per match
  - Allow any stat to grow during matches, but:
    - rangers have higher chance to increase speed
    - tanks have higher chance to increase defense
    - mages have higher chance to increase attack

- Add random injury chance, which will require a swap
- Show scores of previous matches
- CPU training in offseason
- Percentage chance for "Breakout" events in training and matches, where the hero suddenly increases multiple stats by a dramatic amount.

## Future Features (ordered by priority)

- Hero "aura"

  - builds up every turn (including turns when dead), increases signifcantly whenever hero earns a kill
  - when activated, all hero's stats (except health) receive a 2x multiplier
  - lasts for 2 turns

- Different CPU behaviors
  - Defensive CPUs
  - Offensive CPUs
- Respawn timer displayed
- Support for different expressions
